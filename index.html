<p>The aim of this project is to develop a robot demonstration platform to promote the College of Science during Open Days and other public events. It will be based on 
<a href="http://www.strands-project.eu">STRANDS</a> robot platform. 
The robot is particularly designed to engage in interaction with humans by 
means of an articulated head with various sensors to perceive humans in the 
robotâ€™s vicinity, speakers, and a touch screen. The objectives in this project are 
to</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop a software stack for safe and reliable navigation of the robot in 
the presence of humans,</li>
<li>Design simple interaction procedures that get people engaged with the 
robot by approaching them in a pro-active manner, </li>
<li>Implement an interface that provides information about the College of 
Science through the interface, and to</li>
<li>Evaluate the developed system during actual open days to gain further 
insights into the potential of such a system.</li>
</ul><p>This project is a continuation of the <a href="http://publicrobots.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk">Robots@OD project</a> accomplished in summer 2012 by three 
Lincoln CS and GC students. This project is designed as a collaborative project for a team 
of 2-3 students working on different components of the system (people detection, robot 
navigation, interaction design). It is a great opportunity for students to get a first-hand 
experience of state-of-the-art robot hardware and software components. We are looking 
for candidates who can demonstrate very good programming skills (C++, Python, Java)
and are ambitious to take this project all the way to a successful demonstration platform. </p>
