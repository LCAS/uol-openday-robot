{"name":"UoL Openday Robot","tagline":"run Linda, run","body":"uol-openday-robot\r\n=================\r\n\r\nModules for the UOL open day\r\n\r\nmore details, ideas, and discussions to be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/LCAS/uol-openday-robot/wiki/_pages).\r\n\r\n## Project Synopsis\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to develop a robot demonstration platform to promote the College of Science during Open Days and other public events. It will be based on \r\n[STRANDS](http://www.strands-project.eu) robot platform. \r\nThe robot is particularly designed to engage in interaction with humans by \r\nmeans of an articulated head with various sensors to perceive humans in the \r\nrobotâ€™s vicinity, speakers, and a touch screen. The objectives in this project are \r\nto\r\n* Develop a software stack for safe and reliable navigation of the robot in \r\nthe presence of humans,\r\n* Design simple interaction procedures that get people engaged with the \r\nrobot by approaching them in a pro-active manner, \r\n* Implement an interface that provides information about the College of \r\nScience through the interface, and to\r\n* Evaluate the developed system during actual open days to gain further \r\ninsights into the potential of such a system.\r\n\r\nThis project is a continuation of the [Robots@OD project](http://publicrobots.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk) accomplished in summer 2012 by three \r\nLincoln CS and GC students. This project is designed as a collaborative project for a team \r\nof 2-3 students working on different components of the system (people detection, robot \r\nnavigation, interaction design). It is a great opportunity for students to get a first-hand \r\nexperience of state-of-the-art robot hardware and software components. We are looking \r\nfor candidates who can demonstrate very good programming skills (C++, Python, Java)\r\nand are ambitious to take this project all the way to a successful demonstration platform. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
