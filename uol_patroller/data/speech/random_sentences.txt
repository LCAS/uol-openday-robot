Hello and welcome to the university of Lincoln school of computer science. 
My name is Linda.
I will be your guide for today.
congratulations, you’re the tallest person I’ve seen today - mini [robot hight]
please follow me, I will show you the important parts of the school
our first stop will be the coffee table.
coffee
our students enjoy the finer things in life, so our coffee is sainsburys home brand, not sainsburys saver. Please help yourselves. 
In this department we like to offer a relaxed environment for our students to work
But we do expect our students to work hard
I was build as a summer project involving students
we encourage our students to participate like me to teach them how industry works.
we will now continue the tour now
after this we are going to go to the computing labs, please follow me if you are interested
In this lab we have 60 top end computers
For those who like technology, these computers all have 4 gigabytes of ram, a 2TB hard drive, Nvidia A1000 Graphics Card and and i7 4.2ghz cpu
For though who are not technology people, these computers are neat
Next door we have another computing lab, which is identical to this one.
This is where most students do the majority of their work. Most of their workshops will be held in the computing labs. 
This labs are open for students to use for work between 9am and 2am Monday to Thursday.
but we always encourage our students to be organised with their work, so I’m hoping I won't see any of you working that late...
speaking of working late, I think it’s time for another coffee
Please follow me back to the coffee table or if you would prefer to look around yourself, please feel free.
This concludes our tour for today, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask any of the members of staff.
If you would like to leave the school of computing I’ll be heading back to the lift in a moment. 
If not, I hope you have a good day and will look forward to seeing you again sometime.
Thank you.
